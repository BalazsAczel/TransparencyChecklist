This checklist was developed for social and behavioral scientists who conduct and report confirmatory research on primary data.
Nevertheless, several of the checklist items may also be relevant for other approaches and disciplines.
For purely exploratory research, only items 14-24 and 26-36 items of the checklist apply. 


Please respond to each item regarding your study. If necessary, you can provide an explanation to your response at the
end of each section.


Upon completion, you can generate and save a transparency report for your study by pressing the “Generate Report”
at the bottom of the page. The checklist does not save your responses centrally.
